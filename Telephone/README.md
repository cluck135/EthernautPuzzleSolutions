# Telephone solution

Paste the contents of Telephone.sol into RemixIDE.

Make sure the compiler is set to 0.8.0

Then deploy Telephone At Address with the input being the address of the contract instance you get from the ethernaut problem https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/level/0x1ca9f1c518ec5681C2B7F97c7385C0164c3A22Fe

Then deploy TelephoneCaller and run the takeOwnership function with the same address of the Telephone contract instance as the input.

You should now have ownership of the contract and can submit your instance!
