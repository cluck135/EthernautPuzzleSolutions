# CoinFlip Solution

Paste the contents of CoinFlip.sol into remix. 

Set the Compiler version to the same as CoinFlip.sol... 0.8.0. 

Then Deploy the CoinFlipCaller contract. 

Then deploy At Address for the CoinFlip Contract. 

Make sure to use the contract address from the instance you generate from https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/level/0x9240670dbd6476e6a32055E52A0b0756abd26fd2 for the At Address input.

Then run the flipIt function 10 times using again the same address from the instance you made. increase the gas to reduce the chance of an Out Of Gas error from occuring.

Check the consecutiveWins call to make sure it's working.

Then go back to ethernaut and submit your instance to make sure it worked!
